# Global Guidelines

This is a brief summary of the global guidelines and why they matter

## Do

* Be Polite - If you can't be respectful of other members, at least be courteous. Two wrongs don't make a right.
* Be Nice - You may not see it, but a few nice words can make someone’s day better
* Use Search - It's your friend, and it's in the upper-right corner of the forum.
* Stay on Topic - Don't derail threads with your own conversation.
* Think Before you Post - Sensible, well-thought-out, legible posts in the right section are easier to understand.
* Use the Report Feature - If you see a rule violation, this lets the staff know to look at the thread/post and determine the best action.

## Do Not

* OLD Bump Threads - Do not bump threads to get more replies or reply to older threads that have dropped off unless there is significant new information to add.
* NEW Spam - TL;DR, +/-1, one word responses, memes, imageposts, doubleposts, large quotes, etc.
* OLD Reply to Flames or Spam - Just report them
* Post in the Wrong Section - We have specific sections to make things easier to find
* Post server or player black lists - This has been used in the past to hurt innocent people
* Trade or sell Minecraft accounts, this is a forum not a market place. This goes for other digital or physical products too, unless otherwise stated in a section specific rule list.
* Post Giveaways - User-run giveaways or contests for prizes with monetary value are not allowed
* Troll/Flame - See "Be Polite" above. Insulting and baiting will not be tolerated.
* Troll Call - Calling someone a troll is a form of insult and will be treated as such.
* Advertise - You can have a link to your personal (non-commercial) site in your signature. Any other links promoting outside websites or merchandise will be removed.
* Post Redundant Threads - Be aware of other threads in the forum, and don't duplicate (see "Use Search" above).
* Misuse Money Linking Sites - Don’t use sites such as adf.ly for anything other than downloads of your own content. You must also always abide by the services TOS.
* Post hoaxes - Deliberately posting false information. (For example, Herobrine sighting claims).

## How to deal with rule breaking posts that you see

The following information is about what to do when you find people breaking the rules and what happens if you break the rules outlined above.

### Reporting a post

* If you see an infraction to the rules, report it. If you're not sure, report it anyway. There are no penalties if you're wrong
* Don't tell the offender you’re reporting them, it doesn't help the staff in any way and can only lead to problems.
* CHANGED LINE Don't respond to spam, flames, and trolls, much less flame them back. Ignore, report, move on
* If someone is breaking the rules in a post, report the post.  Don’t report in their profile unless their profile itself is breaking the rules.
* When reporting a post please include a reason why you're reporting otherwise we can't deal with the report. CHANGE HERE

#### Mini-Modding

Mini-modding is replyingfghfhg to a rule breaking post with information on the rule break. Some forms of mini-modding are allowed: If a user has broken a section specific rule (such as posting in the wrong section or not including required information) users are allowed to reply to the user explaining what rule has been broken and how to fix the issue. To be acceptable "Mini-modding" the post must neet the following requirements

* Explains which rule the post breaks
* Explains (where necessary) how the poster can rectify the issue CHANGE HERE

Then you must report the post. "Mini-modding" without reporting the post is not allowed.

### Permanent Bans

The administration reserves the right to permanently ban any member whose overall behavior is detrimental to the community.

### Disclaimer
Staff - The administrators and moderators are responsible for the smooth and efficient running of the site. The staff reserves the right to take whatever action is deemed appropriate in any given situation, regardless of whether there is a specific rule covering that situation or not. If there is a misunderstanding or dispute, then please bring the issue up politely with that staff member in private. In all matters, the decision of the administration is final.

## Help And Supports

Sending private messages to staff members is not the correct way to get forum support. If you have a problem with the forum and need help you can post in the "[url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/64-contact-forum-administration/"]Contact Forum Administration[/url]" section which is available under the "Forums" section. This section is monitored by all senior staff and will yield the fastest response to your issue. If you send a private message to a staff member there is a high chance it will be missed and not receive a reply.

Each forum section has an assigned admghjgjhinistrator, they are as follows:s

### Posting Restrictions

We currently have a set of posting restrictions in place for all new members that have been registered for less than 24 hours. These accounts are limited to 10 posts during those first 24 hours and can only create 1 topic every 5 minutes (up to the total of 10). We also have a filter in place that monitors posts for known scams and viruses. These restrictions are in place to help protect the forum and members from spam.
